## *LaFALA's Study Group*
<div style="text-align: justify">
Our lab has a study group that is open to the public. We regularly meet on-lline, each and every 2 weeks, to discuss two texts (one basic and one more elaborate text). Each meeting is unique and draws on the backgrounds and abilities of our members to determine the material that will be covered.  The discussions are conducted by the lab members. We believe that, when students study in groups, they can learn together and motivate and encourage each other. In addition, in our meetings, students are able to develop learning and studying skills.

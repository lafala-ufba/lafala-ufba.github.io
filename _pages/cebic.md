LaFALA is an open research group composed of researchers of different theoretical and methodological backgrounds. However, the **Center for Bilingualism and Complexity Studies**, affiliated with LaFALA is ***exclusively*** anchored on the Complex Dynamic System Theory (an umbrella term that covers many other theories, e.g. Complexity Theory, Dynamic System Theory, Chaos Theory etc.) and seeks to investigate bilingualism. 
<br/>
CeBiC investigates the linguistic, social and cognitive processes that support and govern the development of one or more non-native (oral or sign) languages. Our faculty coordinator is Dr. Felipe Kupske. For more information, feel free to contact any of our members with questions.

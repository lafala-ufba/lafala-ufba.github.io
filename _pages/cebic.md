## *Center for Bilingualism and Complexity Studies*
<div style="text-align: justify">
LaFALA is an open research group composed of researchers of different theoretical and methodological backgrounds. However, the Center for Bilingualism and Complexity Studies is ***exclusively*** anchored on the Complex Dynamic System Theory (an umbrella term that covers many other theories e.g. Complexity Theory, Dynamic System Theory, Chaos Theory etc.) and seeks to investigate bilingualism.

### Welcome to the Speech Sciences Laboratory at UFBA!

<br/>
Drawing on ideas and methods from (but **not solely!**) Psycholinguistics, Laboratory Phonology, Sociolinguistics/Sociophonetics and Experimental Phonetics, our laboratory aims to investigate the multiple facets of native and non-native speech perception and production, such as speech development, variation and change, bilingualism and pronunciation teaching. 

Even with a special attention given to *Phonetics* and *Phonology* and to *oral production*, we are very interested in investigating interface phenomena, including other linguistic levels and cognitive processes. We are also interested in bilingual studies involving sign languages. 

Over the past years, there has been clear progress in *Experimental Linguistics*, and we seek to continue this progress and to leverage the area to build a more complete understanding of **language** and to extend this knowledge to other branches of science.

LaFALA  However, the Center for Bilingualism and Complexity Studies is ***exclusively*** anchored on the Complex Dynamic System Theory (an umbrella term that covers many other theories e.g. Complexity Theory, Dynamic System Theory, Chaos Theory etc.) and seeks to investigate bilingualism.

LaFALA has five main areas of research:

1. **Language Acquisition**: ....
2. **Language Attritio**: ...
3. **Speech Perception and Production**: ...
4. **Heritage and Endangered Languages**: ...
5. **Language Adaptability over lifespan**: ...

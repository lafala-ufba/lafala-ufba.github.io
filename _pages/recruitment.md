# Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining our lab our study group.

## Joining the ftudy group

## Undergraduate students

## Graduate students

Our researchers are members of different Graduate Program. Therefore, if you are interested in being supervised by a specific researcher, please contact her/him/them using the details on our Team tab.

If you are interested in a rotation in our Lab, please contact Dr. Kupske directly.

We are primarily an Experimental Linguistics lab, so a background in the area and in coding (R and Python) and data analysis (R or Python) helps students make the most of their rotation.


## Postdoctoral researchers

We have more data and research ideas than trainees, so are keen to recruit exceptional researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. The lab has expertise in high-performance computing and analytical pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale. We are currently looking for researchers with a strong computational background in:

- Genomic and functional genomic analysis, including whole-genome sequencing, single-cell sequencing, and integrative analysis of genomic and functional genomic data 
- Statistical analysis, including network analysis and quantitative trait analysis
- Genetic therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), gene replacement, and CRISPR-based approaches for the treatment of rare genetic disorders in humans

If you are interested, please contact Dr. Sanders directly using the details on his [USCF profile page](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stephan.sanders).

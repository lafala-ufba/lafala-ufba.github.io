# Joining the Lab or CeBiC

Thank you for your interest in joining our lab or Center of Bilingualism and Complexity Studies, please contact <a href="mailto:kupske@gmail.com">Dr. Kupske</a>. directly.

## Joining the study group

If you are interested in joining our study group, contact us - <a href="mailto:lafala.ufba@gmail.com">lafala.ufba@gmail.com</a>.


## Undergraduate students

If you are interested in joining the lab, contact us - <a href="mailto:lafala.ufba@gmail.com">lafala.ufba@gmail.com</a>.

## Graduate students

Our researchers are members of different Graduate Program. Therefore, if you are interested in being supervised by a specific researcher, please contact her/him/them using the details on our Team tab.

If you are interested in a rotation in our Lab, please contact <a href="mailto:kupske@gmail.com">Dr. Kupske</a>. directly. We are primarily an Experimental Linguistics lab, so a background in the area and in coding (R and Python) and data analysis (R or Python) helps students make the most of their rotation but is not mandatory.

## Postdoctoral researchers

Indeed we have more ideas than students and trainees, so we are keen to welcome researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. 

If you are interested in a rotation in our Lab, please contact <a href="mailto:kupske@gmail.com">Dr. Kupske</a>. directly.

## Visiting or using our facilities
